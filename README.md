# Vue-Otp-Input-Component

# Introduction 

The OTP input component build with Vue + vite, the idea of this project is when i got errand of my role as a frontend engineer, 
the UI team challenges me to build the OTP verification experience look different & more interactive. 

And I thought you can reuse the logic & improve with your own version.

you can find another version build using Vue with the same logic.
